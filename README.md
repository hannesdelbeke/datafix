a more modular version of pyblish
- collect datanodes (e.g. meshes, materials, textures)
- validate your DataNodes, saving the validation outcome (SUCCESS, WARN, FAIL) in resultNodes
- a nice UI to see what's going on
- all nodes are linked to easily query each other for advanced pipelines.

can be run with UI or from console/script
